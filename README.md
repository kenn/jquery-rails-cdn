# jquery-rails-cdn

Add CDN support to [jquery-rails](https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails).

Serving jQuery from a publicly available [CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network) has clear benefits:

* **Speed**: Users will be able to download jQuery from the closest physical location.
* **Caching**: CDN is used so widely that potentially your users may not need to download jQuery at all.
* **Parallelism**: Browsers have a limitation on how many connections can be made to a single host. Using CDN for jQuery offloads a big one.

## Features

This gem offers the following features:

* Supports multiple CDN. (Google, Microsoft, jquery.com, etc.)
* jQuery version is automatically detected via `jquery-rails`.
* Automatically fallback to jquery-rails' bundled jQuery when:
  * You're on a development environment, so that you can work offline.
  * The CDN is down or unreachable.

On top of that, if you're using asset pipeline, you may have noticed that the major chunks of the code in combined `application.js` is jQuery. Implications of externalizing jQuery from `application.js` are:

* Updating your JS code won't evict the entire cache in browsers.
  * Cached jQuery in the client browsers will survive deployments.
  * Your code changes more often than jQuery upgrades, right?
* `rake assets:precompile` will run faster and use less memory.

Changelog:

* v1.0.4: jQuery2 used by default now. Added option `use_v1` option which allows you to use jQuery instead of jQuery2. If `jquery-rails` gem is old and has no jQuery2 then jQuery will be used.
* v1.0.0: Options like `defer: true` or `data-turbolinks-eval: false` are allowed to be passed. (Thanks to @mkitt)
* v0.4.0: Added Cloudflare. (Thanks to @damonmorgan)
* v0.3.0: Microsoft and Yandex are now always scheme-less. (Thanks to @atipugin)
* v0.2.1: Use minified version for Yandex. (Thanks to @atipugin)
* v0.2.0: (Incompatible Change) Google CDN is now always scheme-less. Add Yandex CDN for Russian users. (Thanks to @ai)
* v0.1.0: Added `:google_schemeless` for sites that support both SSL and non-SSL.
* v0.0.1: Initial release

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jquery-rails-cdn'
```

## Usage

This gem adds two methods `jquery_include_tag` and `jquery_url`.

If you're using asset pipeline with Rails 3.1+,

- Remove `//= require jquery` from `application.js`.
- Put the following line in `config/application.rb`, so that jquery.js will be served from your server when CDN is not available.

```ruby
config.assets.precompile += ['jquery2.js']
```
or `config.assets.precompile += ['jquery.js']` if you want to use jQuery v1.

Then in layout:

```ruby
= jquery_include_tag :google
= javascript_include_tag 'application'
```

Note that valid CDN symbols are `:google`, `:microsoft`, `:jquery`, `:cloudflare` and `:yandex`.

Now, it will generate the following on production:

```html
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
window.jQuery || document.write(unescape('%3Cscript src="/assets/jquery-3aaa3fa0b0207a1abcd30555987cd4cc.js" type="text/javascript">%3C/script>'))
//]]>
</script>
```

on development:

```html
<script src="/assets/jquery.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

If you want to check the production URL, you can pass `:force => true` as an option.

```ruby
jquery_include_tag :google, :force => true
```
